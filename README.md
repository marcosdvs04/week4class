# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Paste a sample of your app's CLI or Streamlit output here so a reader can see what a generated plan looks like:

Output of `python3 main.py`:

```
1. TASKS AS ENTERED (unordered)
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Evening walk    Biscuit   medium    25 min   18:00
  Morning walk    Biscuit   high      30 min   07:30
  Breakfast       Biscuit   high      10 min   08:00
  Play session    Luna      low       20 min   afternoon
  Nail trim       Luna      low       15 min   no preference
  Litter box      Luna      high      10 min   09:00

2. AFTER filter_tasks() - only tasks due today
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Evening walk    Biscuit   medium    25 min   18:00
  Morning walk    Biscuit   high      30 min   07:30
  Breakfast       Biscuit   high      10 min   08:00
  Play session    Luna      low       20 min   afternoon
  Litter box      Luna      high      10 min   09:00
  filtered out: Nail trim (Luna) - already completed today

3. AFTER sort_tasks() - high priority and earlier times first
----------------------------------------------------------------
  Morning walk    Biscuit   high      30 min   07:30
  Breakfast       Biscuit   high      10 min   08:00
  Litter box      Luna      high      10 min   09:00
  Evening walk    Biscuit   medium    25 min   18:00
  Play session    Luna      low       20 min   afternoon

TODAY'S SCHEDULE - Tuesday, October 20, 2026
Owner: Marcos   |   Time available: 90 min

09:00-09:10   Litter box          Luna      high        10
18:00-18:25   Evening walk        Biscuit   medium      25
----------------------------------------------------------------
Scheduled: 75 min of 90 min (15 min free)

SKIPPED (ran out of time)
  - Play session (Luna): needs 20 min but only 15 min left

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

> Fill in once you've implemented scheduling logic.

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | | e.g., by priority, duration |
| Filtering | | e.g., skip tasks if time runs out |
| Conflict handling | | e.g., overlapping time slots |
| Recurring tasks | | e.g., daily vs. weekly |
